## Hi 👋

I am a student at the **University of Engineering and Technology – VNU** 👨‍🎓 and currently working at **Viettel Cyber Security** 💼, where I focus on **Purple Team operations and detection testing across security controls**.

My work spans the full **Purple Team lifecycle**, including **adversary scenario design, automated execution, and detection verification** across security products such as **EDR, SIEM, ...**. I design attack scenarios and procedures based on real-world threat intelligence, execute controlled adversary emulation, and verify how behaviors are observed, logged, and detected by different security platforms.

To support scale and consistency, I develop **AI-assisted automation** using **LLMs and RAG** to extract adversary behaviors from **CTI reports**, map them to **MITRE ATT&CK techniques**, generate executable test cases, and accelerate gap analysis or bypass exploration within detection logic. In parallel, I conduct research on applying **AI/ML in Cyber Security**, particularly in **intrusion detection systems (IDS)** and the **robustness and security of AI-powered models**.

I maintain foundation in both **offensive and defensive security**, along with prior experience in **networking, cloud, and system administration**, which enables me to build and evaluate end-to-end security testing workflows.

**Technologies I work with**:
- **Languages**: Go, Python  
- **Cyber Security**: MITRE ATT&CK, Automated Adversary Emulation (Caldera, Atomic Red Team, …)  
- **AI / ML**: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Adversarial Machine Learning  
- **LLMOps**: Dify  
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, GCP, Kubernetes
