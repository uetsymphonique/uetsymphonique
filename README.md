## Hi 👋  
### About Me

I am a student at the **University of Engineering and Technology – VNU** 👨‍🎓 and currently working at **Viettel Cyber Security** 💼, where I focus on **detection testing for security controls**.

My recent interests are centered around **Purple Team operations**, particularly in building **automated workflows** and applying **AI-driven techniques** to optimize security testing processes. In parallel, I am actively exploring the application of **AI in Cyber Security**, including both traditional security problems and the **safety and robustness of AI models** themselves.

### Areas of Interest

- 🔒 **Cyber Security** (Purple Team / Automated Adversary Emulation)  
- 🤖 **AI / Machine Learning & ML / LLMOps**  
- 🌥️ **Cloud Computing**  
- 🖥️ **System & Infrastructure Administration**

---

I am particularly passionate about solving problems related to **Purple Team workflows**, continuously experimenting with new technologies to improve **automation and operational efficiency**.

Currently, I am developing workflows that combine **LLMs and RAG** to:
- Extract adversary behaviors from **CTI reports**
- Map extracted behaviors to **MITRE ATT&CK techniques**
- Generate sample test cases and evaluate the ability to **bypass detection rules**
- Design procedures to bypass existing detection logic when possible  

In addition, I am directly involved in **testing detection capabilities of security controls**, while continuously strengthening my foundational knowledge in Cyber Security across both **offensive and defensive** perspectives.

Previously, I also studied fundamental concepts in **Networking, Cloud, and System Administration**; however, these are not the primary directions I intend to pursue in depth moving forward.
