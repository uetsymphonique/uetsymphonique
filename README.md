## Hi 👋

I am a student at the **University of Engineering and Technology – VNU** 👨‍🎓 and currently working at **Viettel Cyber Security** 💼, focusing on **Purple Team operations and detection testing across security controls**.

My work covers the full **Purple Team lifecycle**, including:
- **Designing adversary scenarios and attack procedures** based on real-world threat intelligence  
- **Executing adversary emulation** in controlled environments  
- **Verifying detection and visibility** across security products such as **EDR, SIEM, and NDR**

To support scalability and consistency, I also build **AI-assisted automation**, where I:
- Use **LLMs and RAG** to extract adversary behaviors from **CTI reports**
- Map extracted behaviors to **MITRE ATT&CK techniques**
- Generate **executable test cases and procedures**
- Accelerate **detection gap analysis and bypass exploration** within existing rule logic

In parallel, I conduct research on applying **AI/ML in Cyber Security**, with a focus on:
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**
- **Adversarial attacks and defenses**
- **Robustness and security of AI-powered models**

I maintain a strong foundation in both **offensive and defensive security**, along with prior experience in **networking, cloud, and system administration**, enabling me to build and evaluate **end-to-end security testing workflows**.

**Technologies I work with**:
- **Languages**: Go, Python  
- **Cyber Security**: MITRE ATT&CK, Automated Adversary Emulation (Caldera, Atomic Red Team, …)  
- **AI / ML**: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Adversarial Machine Learning  
- **LLMOps**: Dify  
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, GCP, Kubernetes
