## Hi 👋

I am a student at the **University of Engineering and Technology – VNU** 👨‍🎓 and currently working at **Viettel Cyber Security** 💼, focusing on **detection testing for security controls**.

My recent interests center on **Purple Team operations**, where I build **automated, AI-assisted workflows** to optimize security testing. In parallel, I explore the application of **AI in Cyber Security**, including both classical security problems and the **robustness and safety of AI models**.

My main areas of interest include **Purple Team & Automated Adversary Emulation**, **AI / Machine Learning & ML/LLMOps**, **Cloud Computing**, and **System & Infrastructure Administration**.

I particularly enjoy working on **Purple Team workflows**, continuously experimenting with new technologies to improve **automation and efficiency**. Currently, I am developing pipelines that combine **LLMs and RAG** to extract adversary behaviors from **CTI reports**, map them to **MITRE ATT&CK techniques**, generate test cases and procedures, and evaluate or bypass detection rules. I also contribute directly to **testing detection capabilities of security controls**, while strengthening my knowledge across both **offensive and defensive** security domains.

Previously, I studied foundational concepts in **Networking, Cloud, and System Administration**, though these are not my primary long-term focus.

**Technologies I work with**:  
- **Languages**: Go, Python  
- **Cyber Security**: MITRE ATT&CK, Automated Adversary Emulation (Caldera, Atomic Red Team, …)  
- **AI / ML**: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Adversarial Machine Learning  
- **LLMOps**: Dify  
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, GCP, Kubernetes

My current projects include **Purple Team automation at VCS**—such as LLM-based TTP extraction, ATT&CK mapping, automated procedure generation, **development of tools to automatically execute adversary emulation scenarios**, and identifying detection gaps—as well as **academic research on AI/ML for IDS and adversarial attacks and defenses in AI-powered IDS**.
